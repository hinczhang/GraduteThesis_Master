## Misleading effect and spatial learning in head-mounted mixed reality-based navigation
### Detail
[Misleading effect and spatial learning in head-mounted mixed reality-based navigation](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/Misleading%20effect%20and%20spatial%20learning%20in%20head%20mounted%20mixed%20reality%20based%20navigation.pdf), 《Geo-spatial Information Science》, 2022, SCI 2, JCR Q2, IF 4.278
### Introduction
Research about how to analyze the spatial recognition influence from incorrect visualization information *(H1)*, and prove the aligned separate holograms require no mental effort *(H2)*.
### Methods
- *H1*  
Add an artificial turn.  
- *H2*  
Two kind of direction indicators.  

Mainly use the questionnaire to inquire the feeling from the testers.
### Results
- *H1*  
Basically approved. 
- *H2*  
Users will focus on the next arrow while without lines, and focus on the real objects while with lines.
### Remark
The paper focuses on the visual interruption research in the mix-reality application. Testers are required.

### Introduction
Design an MR guidance application for the Egyptian museum *MuseumEye*, with the assistance from *HoloLens*.
### Methods
Design the application and then use the questionnaires to investigate the tourists.  
### Results
Prove the effectiveness of the MR device and application.
### Remark
Nothing new, just talk about the design workflow and feedback.
