## Misleading effect and spatial learning in head-mounted mixed reality-based navigation
### Detail
[Misleading effect and spatial learning in head-mounted mixed reality-based navigation](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/Misleading%20effect%20and%20spatial%20learning%20in%20head%20mounted%20mixed%20reality%20based%20navigation.pdf), 《Geo-spatial Information Science》, 2022, SCI 2, JCR Q2, IF 4.278
### Introduction
Research about how to analyze the spatial recognition influence from incorrect visualization information *(H1)*, and prove the aligned separate holograms require no mental effort *(H2)*.
### Methods
- *H1*  
Add an artificial turn.  
- *H2*  
Two kind of direction indicators.  

Mainly use the questionnaire to inquire the feeling from the testers.
### Results
- *H1*  
Basically approved. 
- *H2*  
Users will focus on the next arrow while without lines, and focus on the real objects while with lines.
### Remark
The paper focuses on the visual interruption research in the mix-reality application. Testers are required.
## Design and development of a spatial mixed reality touring guide to the Egyptian museum

### Introduction
Design an MR guidance application for the Egyptian museum *MuseumEye*, with the assistance from *HoloLens*.
### Methods
Design the application and then use the questionnaires to investigate the tourists.  
### Results
Prove the effectiveness of the MR device and application.
### Remark
Nothing new, just talk about the design workflow and feedback.
## The impact of augmented reality on cognitive load and performance: A systematic review
### Detail
[The impact of augmented reality on cognitive load and performance: A systematic review](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/The%20impact%20of%20augmented%20reality%20on%20cognitive%20load%20and%20performance%20A%20systematic%20review.pdf), 《Journal of Computer Assisted Learning》, 2021, SCI 2, JCR Q1, IF 3.761
### Introduction
Research the impact from AR to people's learning ability. The paper is trying to answer this question: whether the AR would increase or decrease cognitive load.
### Methods
This is a review paper so it provides its comprehensive understanding.
### Results
The result shows that the AR is helpful for learning under the consideration of the integrated presentation, which avoids frequent shifting between screens and papers.  

**Some hints realted to spatial aspect**  
The paper mentions *see-through AR using special glasses*, which is like *HoloLens*, which is helpful for navigation due to benefit in the visual guidance system.  
Spatial AR is superior compared to see-through AR, as in the scenario of spatial AR, users can understand the gestures they are familiar with - but it is probably out of our topic (a technique where digital information is displayed directly onto a physical object without the need to carry a device).  
### Remark
Some contradictions: Young et al. (2016) point out that AR is not yet able to overcome cognitive burden occurring during a simulation on driving with an automobile. However, Radu et al. (2014) supports that AR contributes to concentration.
