## The impact of augmented reality on cognitive load and performance: A systematic review
### Detail
[The impact of augmented reality on cognitive load and performance: A systematic review](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/The%20impact%20of%20augmented%20reality%20on%20cognitive%20load%20and%20performance%20A%20systematic%20review.pdf), 《Journal of Computer Assisted Learning》, 2021, SCI 2, JCR Q1, IF 3.761
### Introduction
Research the impact from AR to people's learning ability. The paper is trying to answer this question: whether the AR would increase or decrease cognitive load.
### Methods
This is a review paper so it provides its comprehensive understanding.
### Results
The result shows that the AR is helpful for learning under the consideration of the integrated presentation, which avoids frequent shifting between screens and papers.  

**Some hints realted to spatial aspect**  
The paper mentions *see-through AR using special glasses*, which is like *HoloLens*, which is helpful for navigation due to benefit in the visual guidance system.  
Spatial AR is superior compared to see-through AR, as in the scenario of spatial AR, users can understand the gestures they are familiar with - but it is probably out of our topic (a technique where digital information is displayed directly onto a physical object without the need to carry a device).  
### Remark
Some contradictions: Young et al. (2016) point out that AR is not yet able to overcome cognitive burden occurring during a simulation on driving with an automobile. However, Radu et al. (2014) supports that AR contributes to concentration.

### Introduction
Raise a general framework for MR development. Define MR functions: compared with AR, it could interact with the real objects
### Methods
It is a kind of review paper. Three questions are raised:  
- Q1: Which concepts are necessary to create a generic framework for MR applications?  
- Q2: Which components are necessary in MR applications to create a general MR framework?  
- Q3: What are the future prospects of the proposed framework?
### Results
The research results were twofold, comprising a generic framework and its necessary components for MR applications. The proposed framework is made up of five layers: *MR concepts*, *MR systems
architecture*, *MR Middleware*, *MR applications*, and *MR user interface (UI)*.
### Remark
Just some definition of MR. Might be used as the terminology reference.

### Introduction
The paper mainly researches the influence from the text in the Google glass. As in the AR or MR research, researchers always put texts or symbols on the screen, which might cause negative effect on users, for example, no-concentration on surroundings or mistakes.
### Methods
20 participants with driving licenses and also reading messages during driving. Texts are played on the glass and the participants should read as more as possible, with the volume and mistakes recording.  
Use some indicators:  
- The NASA – Raw Task Load Index (NASA-RTLX) (Byers et al.,
1989) 
### Results
1. People cannot gain experience in using Google glass with limitation.  
2. Compared with mobile phone, the lane excursions have no great difference.  
3. Reading in the glass has more advantage
### Remark
The AR or MR device might lead to the ignorance of the surroundings.

### Introduction
Try to chunck the space to let the users learn by MR. Chuncking space should lead to a better memory.
### Methods
Use VGI to understand that how people try to separate the space, as VGI is the open-source data of recording people's daily perception. The method sets some decision points with different granularity.
### Results
Expect to gain more knowledge with the help of chuncking.
### Remark
Give a universal experiment for such kind of researches.

- instruction visualization
  
For the part about user study design, please refer to: *Doctoral Colloquium—Towards a Better User Interface of Augmented Reality Based Indoor Navigation Application*.  
  
There are four ways to develop it:  
- Local Anchor–Predefined Path Approach: no network, prototype, predefined.  
- Local Anchor–Generated Path Approach: more flexible, allow to set the first target.  
- Cloud Anchor–Predefined Path Approach: with network  
- Cloud Anchor–Generated Path Approach: with network

## Spatial knowledge acquisition with virtual semantic landmarks in mixed reality-based indoor navigation
### Detail
[Spatial knowledge acquisition with virtual semantic landmarks in mixed reality-based indoor navigation](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/BingLiu/Spatial%20knowledge%20acquisition%20with%20virtual%20semantic%20landmarks%20in%20mixed%20reality%20based%20indoor%20navigation.pdf), 《Cartography and Geographic Information Science》, 2021, SCI 3, JCR Q3, IF 2.354
### Introduction
Set virtual landmarks which are hardly seen in the indoor environment. The research assumes that the virual landmarks should assist spatial learning.
### Methods
Choose an area in TUM campus with similar outlooks (white wall and grey door). There are rooms with different functions but without salient landmarks. There are 28 participants. The experiment uses *Q1-Q15, Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale* to measure the spatial learning performance.
### Result
The result shows that the MR and virtual landmarks are helpful for indoor spatial learning, and most volunteers give positive feedback to the application.
### Remark
The paper gives reference to the experiment design related to spatial settings.

[Wayfinding Behavior and Spatial Knowledge Acquisition: Are They the Same in Virtual Reality and in Real-World Environments?](https://github.com/hinczhang/GraduteThesis_Master/blob/main/Papers/BingLiu/Wayfinding%20Behavior%20and%20Spatial%20Knowledge%20Acquisition_Are%20They%20the%20Same%20in%20Virtual%20Reality%20%20and%20in%20Real-World%20Environments.pdf), 《Annals of the American Association of Geographers》, 2021, SCI 2, JCR Q1, IF 3.982
### Introduction
Use eye-tracking to track the eye movement, in order to understand users' focus. The paper assumes that pedestrians in iVR would exhibit the same wayfinding behavior and obtain equivalent spatial knowledge compared with pedestrians in real environment.
### Methods
40 participants in iVR and 25 in RE, with a table to evaluate their performance. The iVR environment is carried by HMD. The participants need to draw the sketch and recall the focus process.  
After that, data process is required. Way-finding efficiency and effectiveness are measured. The paper use many metrics to quantify these concepts. 
### Result
The result shows that the the efficiency is similar under two kind of situations. But iVR users show more active feedback to the sketching task... And some other comparisons. iVR users might have better performance on spatial learning under normalized situation.
### Remark
A new idea: eye-tracking.
